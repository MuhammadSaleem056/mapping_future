Introduction
Before we start mapping there are some considerations to be taken into account. As this mapping is for pre-disaster scenario so the mapping area should be selected such that the area is prone to some disaster. This is done using the thinkhazard website which uses best available hazard data to define their hazard levels.
NEED-FOR-ACTION
After the study area is selected it's time to decide how we can proceed with improving the OpenStreetMap (OSM) in the area. Options are very limited If high levels of detail are to be mapped. But two types of action could be tested that is validation and mapping certain tags. Validation is done on the generic QA maps. Mapping is done in this case is for the vulnerability QA maps because it is assumed as higher priority than the generic maps as it represents infrastructure (feature) that could be in hazard prone areas.

Validation
Validation with different imageries, because of the connection to the experience mappers or out of date features. Digitise again the critical infrastructure for the purpose of validation. In addition to this, we already specify the area and what is needed there to be mapped. Then the NEED-FOR-ACTION is defined. This connection is with the research of “where to map”. This mapathon is to validate the areas where it has been mapped by inexperienced mappers and to map the foot-prints of the buildings and/or roads. To measure the success of the approach is to visualise the mapped area by the experienced mappers and check if the area is mapped accurately. Initial assumption is that there will be some footprints of the building left unmapped.
Mapping
The most common tag which has importance with regards to rescue operation and that could be mapped from the satellite images is the roof:shape tag of the buildings. Moreover if the imagery is of high-quality condition of roof and building can also be mapped.
Prediction can be done by looking at the neighbouring buildings that has been mapped by some field survey which in our case in METEOR project in Dar es Salaam. Analysing these tags will give mappers information about how the buildings with certain tags looks like through satellite images. These samples will be provided to the mappers before they can start adding roof:shape tags. 
To measure the success of this action mappers should be given All grid of the area vs specific grid for the purpose such as tag mentioned above. ArcGIS esri images would be better downloaded from SAS planet and used for mapping.
Action plan
Koos agreed that he can create a task for me in the tasking manager for the area to be mapped. Mappers can be divided into two groups depending on the action:
Validation
Two groups can be splitted by providing 2 different areas nearby. First area is the area that has been mapped previously by in-experienced mappers. Second area is the area that has been mapped by experienced mappers. The results will be compared using overpass API queries and mappers feedback from both groups.
Mapping of tags
Two groups can be splitted by providing 2 different areas. First group will be given an area with grids that has been analysed for missing tags. While other groups are given a random area without analysis for missing tags. The comparison will be based on time required to map and feedback from the mappers from both groups. 
Note: Difference between two groups here is in the first group it is already known that there are tag missing and second group have to first find out that first where the tag is missing then observe from the training sets to add the tag.
