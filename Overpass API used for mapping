To get the stats of mappers in the area

Check the local mappers range and less than 100 edits mappers were chosen

To get the data edited by all unexperienced mappers
[out:json][bbox:{{bbox}}];

Overlapping of building foot-prints


Unmapped area

Another aspects is that areas that are mapped by the inexperienced mapper can be incomplete.

Wrong edits 
According to the profile the buildings are close to one another and there are building standalone.
[out:json][bbox:{{bbox}}];
(
nwr(user:"DoubleA")["building"];
nwr(user:"WalkerB")["building"];
nwr(user:"Olclarkey19")["building"];
nwr(user:"Palolo")["building"];
nwr(user:"FUS RO DAH66")["building"];
nwr(user:"andbox")["building"];
nwr(user:"Kass Prod")["building"];
nwr(user:"Sal73x")["building"];
nwr(user:"Spidey10")["building"];
nwr(user:"jharpster")["building"];
nwr(user:"TazaraLynn")["building"];

This picture shows the area mapped by the experienced mapper.
Query for getting the roads near the buildings and this will see if there are no buildings nearby.
[out:json][timeout:360];
nwr["building"]({{bbox}}); 
way(around:5)["highway"]({{bbox}});

)->.highwayNearBuilding; 

// determine banks far from police stations

// return node, ways, relations as determined above
out geom meta;
